    # If you look at the articles controller, you see that you set an instance variable
    # called @articles that contains the articles collection. Rails gives you the ability
    # to test whether this assignment was successful by way of the assigns method:
    # assert_not_nil assigns(:articles)
    # This asserts that @articles was, in fact, assigned (by virtue of the fact that
    # it shouldnâ€™t be nil). You can use this technique to test for the existence
    # of any instance variable set within your controllers.
